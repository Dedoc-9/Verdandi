# The rungs — Verðandi's ledger

One entry per rung, in the order they landed. Each states what was measured, what it does not show, and the
row that reddens if the claim is false. Grades: MEASURED (a row computes it live), ESTABLISHED (read off the
code or the frozen record), DECLARED (stated, not yet earned).

## KERNEL-0 — the placement reproduces the oracle natively, against the tag

**What landed.** `kernel/mantle.rs` — Urðr's `tools/terrain/mantle_rs/mantle.rs` at `urdr-oracle-1`
(source sha256 `9e8a8f7d…`), made a library: the same constants, SHA-256, traversal in reduced rationals,
strip and floor fills, texture coordinates and per-band emission, with `pub` visibility, the scene parser
returning a typed `Refusal`, and the command line moved to `kernel/main.rs`. `kernel/formats.rs` — the
studio's three input formats: **W** the level (`VRDNLVL1`: cells, depth, the depth's table and band maps),
**M** the tiles (`VRDNTIL1`), **C** the camera (carried, inside neither), and their composition into the
`URDRMNTI` bytes the oracle fixes as the kernel's input. `oracle/levels/*.lvl` (witness `0xABCDE/1`,
corridor `0/1`, room `12345/7`, landmark `0xC0FFEE/2`, neighbour `0xABCDF/1`), `oracle/tiles/{identity,
oriented}.tiles` and `oracle/witnesses.json` — frozen live from Urðr at `4c8c2451` (CPython 3.11.15, Linux,
`PYTHONHASHSEED=0`), every level beside Urðr's own `level_digest`, every tile set beside Urðr's `tiles_digest`.

**Rows.** `oracle-frozen` — every W and M equals its file's sha256; the witness scene's frame, identity pixels
and oriented pixels equal `urdr-oracle-1.json`; corridor and pointblank share a level. `kernel-build` — the
kernel compiles live. `kernel-oracle` — the placement prints the oracle's frame digest `9bb45bf3…` and
identity pixel sha `0bef7c1e…` at (34, 28) facing W, twice. `kernel-corpus` — 12 witnesses over 6 scenes ×
2 tile sets equal the frozen values, and within each scene both tile sets share one frame digest.
`kernel-selftest` — a mirrored sign table moves 6 of 6 oriented pictures and no frame digest and no identity
picture: the rows can redden, and geometry and appearance are distinct witnesses.

**Grade.** MEASURED: both witnesses on every corpus scene, the selftest control, the corpus's self-consistency.
ESTABLISHED: the port changed visibility and shape and no arithmetic (read off the diff against the tag's
source). DECLARED: nothing.

**does_not_show.** `D_0` — Urðr's composed CORE identity (level, entity, RNG stream, action log) is carried
in the oracle as evidence and is neither recomputed nor minted here. Any frame budget (off-gate:
`kernel --bench N --warm M` on a named host; the owner's Urðr record stands at p99 12,319 µs within 60 Hz).
That the corpus is representative — six scenes, two tile sets. A window, a present, an input.

**Falsifier.** `kernel-oracle` and `kernel-corpus` redden on any drift in the arithmetic; `kernel-selftest`
reddens if the comparison ever stops biting.
