# Roadmap — toward a live, authorable world

*Where the program stands, what "a live authorable world" means for it, and the sequenced, falsifiable path to get
there. This roadmap names only rungs that are already public in [`verify/RUNGS.md`](../verify/RUNGS.md); the
general techniques it points at are cited prior art, not commitments. Specific new measurement and execution rungs
are under private consideration pending the owner's consensus and are not enumerated here.*

## Where we are

Two halves of the studio are built and sealed. The **render** half is fast and honest: the emit is ~3.3× faster than
the certified baseline (a stable ~2,355 µs p99 at eight threads), byte-identical to the frozen oracle at every step,
and the shell now renders through that parallel fast path. The **authoring** half already exists in skeleton:
`WORKSHOP-0/1` turn an edit into a new authority with a hash-chained consequence record; `INPUT-0` turns shell input
into a typed command and a new camera that replays headless; `SESSION-WALK` interleaves moving and authoring into one
sealed chain; and `SHELL-PLAYBACK` proves the window shows *exactly* that sealed becoming. And since `GAME-0`, Urðr's
**game layer** — seventeen discrete vertical slices, from level generation through the input membrane, with their
corpora and suites — sits in `oracle/game/` as frozen evidence from the same tag, passing its own 411 tests in place.

What is *not* yet joined is the loop between them at interactive speed: editing the world **while** the window shows
it, and seeing the consequence immediately, all through the same sealed representation — and doing it for semantics
the frozen oracle never certified.

## What "live authorable world" means here

Not a general game engine. Specifically: **a running window in which an author changes the world, the change becomes
a new authority through the sealed workshop path, the projection updates live, and every frame on the screen is
provably the consequence of that authored history** — with new kinds of world content (skybox, filtering semantics,
physics beyond what the tag carries) admitted only when they *earn* an authority, either carried or re-frozen from Urðr
or pinned by a Verðandi-local reference. The bar is the one the program already holds itself to: `built ≠ adopted`, `declared ≠ verified`, and no
semantics reaches the screen without passing through a gate.

---

## The gap, in four questions

1. **Does the render headroom reach the screen?** Measured once (`LATENCY-1R`): yes for work arriving at a random
   phase (composited output 3.6 ms earlier at the median), no for a loop that renders right after it presents (fully
   absorbed by the refresh-coupled GDI present). The shell's whole render-start → frame-ready interval is ~15 ms, longer
   than one refresh on the owner's host. *(G7 — confirmation pending; G8 — the split is next.)*
2. **Can an author edit the live window?** The pieces exist headless (input → typed edit → SESSION-WALK); they are
   not yet wired into the running present loop with live re-projection.
3. **Can the world hold semantics the oracle never certified?** The skybox and filtered VIEW semantics live *beyond*
   the frozen oracle and need the new-semantics route. Physics is different: much of it is already in the tag (see
   below), so the question there is what to carry, not what to invent.
4. **Can independent edits combine?** Two authored branches of a world need a deterministic, consensus-free merge.

---

## The sequenced path (named rungs only)

### LATENCY-1 — does the headroom survive the present path · **measured and confirmed** (`8e93118e`, amended `b32d226f`)
Re-run the sealed reference session through the present path *now that the render is fast*, and compare frame-ready →
composited against `LATENCY-0`'s immutable baseline. This is a **measurement, not an optimization** — it was meant to
answer question 1; the amendment below records why it cannot, and LATENCY-1R does. Off-gate, host, witnesses first, no refresh claim.
The method is hash-locked (`latency1-preregistered`): the comparator is `LATENCY-0`'s sealed **frame-ready →
composited** p99 — the *same observable*, inherited never re-derived — and **never** an emit p99 (the GAUNTLET-2
7,734 µs baseline is a different observable; mixing them is a category error). The delta reads as
headroom-propagates / presentation-dominant / shell-contention, and none of it proves input-to-photon.

**Amended before the number (LATENCY-1a, `b32d226f`).** LATENCY-0's instrument renders every frame before its window
opens and times only blit → composited, so LATENCY-1 cannot see the renderer; its delta is now read as a statement
about the presentation interval only (a 50‰ materiality bound, declared), never as render headroom or contention.

**Measured.** On the owner's host LATENCY-1's first run read DEGRADATION on a three-sample p99 tail; its confirmation
read NO MATERIAL CHANGE (p99 7,339 vs 7,318 µs). The presentation interval reproduces LATENCY-0, and the first run's
category did not reproduce (`GHOSTS.md` G10).

### LATENCY-1R — the render inside the clock · **measured once** (`5cfb3ece`), confirmation pending
The question LATENCY-1 cannot answer, as its own observable: render-start → composited on the same sealed session
and GDI present, for the production render (T=8) against the single-thread reference, in a locked and a uniform
phase regime. On the owner's host: **locked ABSORBED** (the ~2.6 ms render saving becomes composition wait, 0‰) and
**uniform PROPAGATES** (composited output 3.6 ms earlier at the median, 1,341‰). The production render-start →
frame-ready interval itself is 15.4 ms at p50, longer than the 13.9 ms refresh. Next: `--confirm`, then split that
interval phase by phase (`GHOSTS.md` G8) before choosing the next target.

### PRESENT-1 — decouple present from refresh (LATENCY-1R measured the coupling absorbing the render headroom in phase)
`LATENCY-0` *established* only that the composed-GDI present costs at least one refresh interval. `PRESENT-1`'s
falsifiable hypothesis — to be measured, never assumed — is that a **flip-model / waitable-swapchain** present can
decouple present latency from refresh. The prior art is well documented: the DXGI flip model shares frames directly
with the compositor with minimal copies, a frame-latency waitable object reaches ~1 frame of latency in Independent
Flip (and lets the DWM sleep), and `ALLOW_TEARING` with multi-plane overlay goes lower still. Built std-only against
raw Win32/COM (as `win32.rs` already hand-rolls GDI); off-gate; `HARDWARE-144` additionally needs a ≥144 Hz panel.

### Interactive capture — the inverse of SHELL-PLAYBACK
Raw window/device event → binding → typed action/edit → `SESSION-WALK` append → the *same* sealed representation that
headless authoring produces. `SHELL-PLAYBACK` already proves a sealed session replays to the exact window frames;
interactive capture closes the loop so a *live* edit produces a sealed session that would replay identically. A
shell/input problem, not a new authority — measured against the existing session machinery, never modifying it. The
industry pattern to borrow is the **authoring-data / runtime-data split** (e.g. Unity DOTS), with deterministic step
and reload atomicity — which is exactly the workshop's edit → authority → record shape.

### SEMANTIC-0 — a float-free, geometry-bound semantic layer
New VIEW semantics the studio did not inherit (filtering, variety) earned by a Verðandi-local reference pinned by
rows here, as the HUD's pins are — CORE semantics have one route only (Urðr, re-frozen). This is the rung that lets
the world mean *more* than the frozen oracle certified, without ever letting the shell mint that meaning.

### MERGE-0 — deterministic, consensus-free merge of non-conflicting edits
Combine two authored branches of a world with a merge that is commutative, associative and idempotent, **stripped of
consensus and wall-clock** — the join-semilattice discipline of conflict-free replicated data types, but applied to
an authored, hash-chained edit history rather than a live distributed store. The prior art (state-based and
delta-state CRDTs; deterministic lockstep simulation) supplies the convergence theory; the Verðandi constraint is
that the merge must produce a *sealed, replayable* history whose result is byte-identical regardless of merge order.

### GAME-0 — Urðr's game layer as frozen evidence · **landed**
The seventeen discrete game-layer slices (`gamegen` … `cue`), their corpora, suites, briefs and the D24/D25 boundaries,
carried verbatim from `urdr-oracle-1` into `oracle/game/`, each file listed with its sha256 and Urðr git blob id, and
Urðr's own suites passing in place (`game-frozen`, `game-suites`, `game-plant`, `game-not-runtime`). Evidence, not a
runtime dependency: the kernel, workshop and shell do not read it.

### SKYBOX-0 / PHYSICS-0 — the skybox beyond the oracle; physics already in the tag
The skybox stays *beyond* the frozen oracle and is gated behind the new-semantics route (`SEMANTIC-0`'s machinery):
named, courted, and not seated until that route exists. Physics is not in the same position. An earlier version of
this roadmap said it was beyond the oracle, and that was wrong. `urdr-oracle-1` carries Urðr's exact ℤ/ℚ mechanics
(rungs 1–4), its bounded Q32.32 real-time path (rung 5) and its lockstep/rollback netcode, all as earned CORE
semantics with frozen corpora. They reach the studio by the `GAME-0` route, and only physics the tag does not carry
needs the new-semantics route.

### IMPOSSIBILITY-0 — measured negative results as level preconditions
Some world states are *provably unreachable*; recording those impossibilities as level preconditions is itself a
form of authored semantics, and a natural companion to `SEMANTIC-0`.

## The invariants that carry forward

Everything above obeys the same discipline that carried the render campaign:

- **Earn the authority.** CORE semantics come only from Urðr: carried verbatim from the tag already cited (as
  `GAME-0` carries the game layer), or earned there and re-frozen under a new name. New VIEW semantics may be
  Verðandi-local but must be pinned by rows here. The shell never mints truth.
- **Byte-identity where an oracle exists; a pinned reference where one does not.** A rung with a frozen oracle proves
  byte-identity against it; a rung inventing new semantics defines a reference and pins it, then defends *that*.
- **Preregister the method before the number,** including the failure condition and the null. Measure before
  optimize; re-measure after. Correctness on the gate, speed off it. The record stores numbers; the reading
  interprets.

The render half proved this discipline scales to a hard optimization campaign. The authoring half is where it meets
its more interesting test: proving that a *living, editable world* can be as honestly evidenced as a static picture.
